Week 2 Challenge

This weeks challenge was to create a portfolio page which we will be adding to as the course progresses. This will allow us to showcase our work to potential employers. 

We were assigned to create a portfolio page with a photo of us and links to sections about us, about our work and how to contact us. When the links are clicked the page us navigated down to that section. When you click on the section about our work you are brought to a section with images of my work. The first application is the largest. When you click on the image then you are taken to that deployed application. When you resize the page below 980px you will see the hero image adjust and re-center to that viewport.
